**Purpose of the application**
The purpose of TaskHub is to create a place where people can collaborate on boards and create shared to-do lists, idea boards and brainstorms. We actually intended the application to be used in place of the default new tab screen as a way to maximise productivity and have an easy way to access your to-do lists and any other information you may need while working.

**The Design**
The design of TaskHub is minimal and sleek. We wanted a professional look to the application and to make it feel comfortable to use. We made sure all of the navigation around the website felt intuitive and easy so anyone can pick up the application and use it off the bat.

**How to run**
1. Download all of the files from this repository
2. Open up the folder in the terminal (or in your virtual environment)
3. Run `flask run` (or if you are on windows `python -m flask run`)
4. Open the IP address given by flask in your preferred browser and enjoy!

**Testing Process**
1. Run the application: `flask run`
2. Run the tests: `pytest`
